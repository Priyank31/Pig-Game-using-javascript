## About The Game
- Pig game is a simple 2 player game where players have to score points by rolling a dice.
- Player can roll dice any number of times and the tally will be added to the current score.
- But if a player roll a **'1'** then the player loses the current score and also loses his/her turn.
- Player can use **'Hold'** option to add the current score to their final score and pass the turn.
- First player to score **100 points** wins the game.
